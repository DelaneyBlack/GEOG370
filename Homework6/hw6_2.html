    <h1>Homework 6.2: Census data ratios and categories</h1>
    <h2>Delaney Black</h2>
    <h3>The following choropleths represent the unemployment rate in Georgia by county. The ratio used to determine this data was the number of unemployed people (per county) divided by the county's total workforce. Here, the "total workforce" refers to the number of working-age (16-65) people, while "unemployed" refers to the population of the workforce that does not currently hold a job.</h3>

    <h3>Equal Count</h3>

        </a>
    <p>Equal count helps clearly contrast the highest and lowest unemployment rates. However, it can be miseading because it assigns color based on the values of other counties, which means values that are very cloess may appear to be much different.</p>

 <h3>Pretty Breaks</h3>

    </a>
<p>Pretty breaks has a very clear legend. however, because the decimal values in this graph are rounded to the tenth place, this benefit is not very useful. In data with higher values, pretty breaks would be a strong classification style, but here it just reduces contrast in the map.</p>

<p>Natural breaks clearly shows the contrast in areas with high unemployment rates and low unemployment rates. While it can be misleading because the values are not evenly separated, it is the strongest classification system for this data.</p>
