    <h1>In this project I learned how to display images in different projections</h1>
    
    <h2 style="color:rgb(0, 89, 255)">Describe in your own words how you displayed the map in different projections using QGIS</h2>
    <p>After downloading the natural earth shapefile, the map was displayed in different projections in QGIS. First, the Indicatrix plugin icon was selected, and after hitting run, the point and line guidelines were projected over the world map. In the bottom right corner, the projection properties can be found, where you can change which projection your map is displayed in. Projections in this property use different coordinate reference systems, each that is designed to project either world or regional locations, and each that distorts and maintains different aspects. Because the earth is a round 3D object, every projection features some level of distortion, so choosing one depends on what needs to be maintained and what distortions you are willing to sacrifice. After selecting a coordinate reference system, you can hit OK and QGIS loads the map in that projection system. The map can then be downloaded as a .png file.</p>
    
    <h2>WGS84 Projection</h2>
    <h3>The WGS 84 map is a cylindrical projection that distorts area, shape, and size as you move away from the equator, which is the standard line.</h3>

    <h2>Aitoff Projection</h2>
    <h3>The Aitoff Projection distorts shape, size, area, and direction. The purpose of this projection is to visualize the round shape of the earth and to minimize distortion of direction snd size.</h3>

    <h2 style="color:red">Now, you should <u>add the following projections on your own:</u></h2>
    <h3>EPSG: 3857, 53018, 54034, 54027, 102016, and two additional projections that you choose.</h3>
    <p></p>
    <h2>Pseudo-Mercator: EPSG 3857 Projection</h2>
    <h3>The Pseudo-Mercator Projection conserves the shape of landmasses but distorts area. The standard line of this projection is the equator, at which point minimal distortion occurs. As the distance from the equator increases, as does the size distortion.</h3>

    </a>
    <h2>Sphere Winkel I: EPSG 53018 Projection</h2>
    <h3>The Sphere Winkel I projection demonstrates some curvature of the earth but distorts size, direction, area, and shape. It is useful for visualizing the general shape of the earth but is likely not useful for projections that require no distortion in any of the above categories.</h3>

    <img src="./Worldprojections /touse/53018-sphere-winkel-I.png" alt="Aitoff" width='500px'>
    </a><h2>World Azimuthal Equidistant: EPSG54034 Projection</h2>
    <h3>The Azimuthal Equidistant Projection conserves direction from the standard point but distorts shape and size. The standard point, at which minimal distortion occurs, is usually the north or south pole, and the projection is displayed on a circle.</h3>

    <img src="./Worldprojections /mapsmade/world-azimuthal-equidistant.png" alt="WGS84" width='500px'>
    </a>
    <h2>World Equidistant Conic: EPSG 54027 Projection</h2>
    <h3>The World Equidistant Conic projection distorts area, shape, and direction,  maintaining distance and scale along the standard lines. It demonstrates the round shape of the earth, but some areas are so heavily distorted that it is difficult to use.</h3>
    <a href="./Worldprojections /touse/54027-world-equidistant-conic.png">
    <img src="./Worldprojections /touse/54027-world-equidistant-conic.png" alt="Aitoff" width='500px'>
    </a><h2>North Pole Azimuthal Equidistant: EPSG 102016 Projection</h2>
    <h3>Similar to the World Equidistant Conic, the North Pole Azimuthal Equidistant projection distorts area, shape, and direction, while showing the round shape of the earth. Unlike the prior projection, this one has a stronger focus on the north pole and comparatively minimizes distortion in that area.</h3>

    </a>
    <h2>World Behrmann: ESRI 54017 Projection</h2>
    <h3>The World Behrmann is a cylindrical projection that increases in distortion of  shape, size, and area as you move away from the standard lines. This projection’s standard lines are located along the 30° north, 30° south, 30° east, and 30° west lines.</h3>

    <img src="./Worldprojections /mapsmade/world-behrmann.png" alt="Aitoff" width='500px'>
    </a>
    <h2>World Times: ESRI 54048 Projection</h2>
    <h3>Compared to the World Behrmann, the World Times projection has less distortion of area and shape along most of the world, progressively getting more distorted as you move closer to the poles. The World Times also features slightly curved Lattitude/ Longitude lines, whereas the World Behrmann/s lines are straight. </h3>
